

Data Collection: The system begins by collecting images or videos of students to create a database. This database stores facial data that the system will use to recognize each student.


Face Detection: When a student enters the classroom, the system uses a camera to capture their image. It then detects the face within the image, often using algorithms like Haar cascades1.

Recognition and Verification: The facial signature is compared with the stored data in the database. If a match is found, the system verifies the studentâ€™s identity.


Attendance Marking: Once verified, the system marks the student as present. This can be done in real-time as students enter the classroom, ensuring an efficient and accurate attendance process.

Reporting: The system can generate attendance reports for each class, which can be accessed by teachers and students.
